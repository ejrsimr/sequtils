# OBJECTIVE
# for each position in genome search upstream in a window
# for aligning sequence in opposite strand
# return matches with identity >= x of length >= Y
# with a minimum distance of Z

# current code doesn't extent to maximum ITRs

# for multi-processing, we could split genome into a list of pieces
# pieces need to overlap by window size - 1?
